# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes-related eye disease that can lead to blindness if not detected early. This project aims to build a machine learning system that automatically identifies signs of diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques, the model helps in early screening and supports ophthalmologists in clinical decision-making.

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient machine learning model that can classify retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy or detect the presence of the disease.

Key Features
* Automated detection of diabetic retinopathy using retinal fundus images
* Image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and contrast enhancement
* Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or transfer learning (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3)
* Multi-class or binary classification
* Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
* Deployment-ready pipeline using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV

Workflow
1. Dataset Collection: Acquire labelled retinal images from publicly available datasets such as Kaggle’s “APTOS” or “EyePACS”.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, remove low-quality images, resize images, normalize pixels, and apply augmentation.
3. Model Training: Build a CNN or apply transfer learning to classify images into DR stages.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using validation metrics.
5. Prediction System: Build a script or application that takes a retinal image and predicts the DR level.
6. Visualization: Display sample predictions and show confusion matrix or classification reports.

Applications
* Early screening in hospitals and clinics
* Supporting ophthalmologists in diagnosis
* Reducing manual analysis time in large-scale screening programs
* Can be extended to mobile screening tools
